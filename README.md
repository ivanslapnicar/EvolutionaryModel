# Universal Evolutionary Model for Periodical Organisms

Accompanying Julia code for the paper "Universal evolutionary model for periodical organisms"

```
Eric Goles, Ivan Slapničar and Marco A. Lardies: Universal evolutionary model for periodical organisms, arXiv:2010.00940, submitted
```

The manuscript can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00940).

The code in the file `Simulation.jl` (also in the Pluto notebook `Simulation_p.jl`) was used to run all simulations and produce all figures in the paper.

## Installing

Download the repository either as zip-file or clone it to your local file system by running

```
git clone git@github.com:ivanslapnicar/EvolutionaryModel.jl.git
```

## Running the simulations

At Julia prompt, run

`include("Simulation.jl")`

Alternatevely, you can use the Pluto notebook `Simulation_p.jl`.
